## 3.2-1
f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions
1. Given monotonically increasing by definition, assume there is a function 
```
h(n) = f(n) + g(n)
```

if (m &le; n) then <br>
f(m) &le; f(n) <br>
g(m) &le; g(n)

Adding both sides of the inequalities: <br>
f(m) + g(m) &le; f(n) + g(n) <br>
=> h(m) &le; h(n)
